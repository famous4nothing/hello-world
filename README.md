# hello-world
The beginning of my learn to code journey. 30 year old female with too much time on her hands. might as well do something productive. Check er out.!
Not to sure what to say here, other than Im a girl, im new to this, so bear with me. I also am going through alot right now and Im looking to use this as 
a release to some built up stress and something to keep my mind occupied. 
who knows? maybe I will end up creating something spectacular. 

Im not sure what type of projects im thinking about starting right now but I Love music and I love earning money at home so I can be a productive
stay at home single mom. so something involving the 2 might be the start of a brainstorm... maybe. 

either way whatever I decide, I hope you come along for the ride and help me out :)
